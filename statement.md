 Project Statement – Number Guessing Game
1. Problem Statement
Many beginners find it challenging to understand how user input, loops, and condition checking work together in programming.
To make the learning process interactive and simple, this project focuses on building a small game where the computer selects a random number and the user tries to guess it.
The goal is to design a program that:
	•	Generates a secret number.
	•	Takes user guesses.
	•	Compares the guesses with the correct number.
	•	Gives feedback until the correct number is guessed.
	•	Allows users to reveal the answer when needed.
2. Scope of the Project
The project covers:
	•	Basic Python programming
	•	Random number generation
	•	User input handling
	•	Continuous looping through guesses
	•	Conditional decision-making
  	•	Displaying results to the user
This project is designed for introductory programming and does not involve external libraries or advanced UI components.
It serves as a good example of how simple logic can build a functional interactive game.
3. Target Users
	•	Beginners learning Python
	•	Students in introductory programming courses
	•	Anyone who enjoys simple console-based games
	•	Users who want to practice guessing and logical thinking
4. High-Level Features
	1.	Random Number Generation
The game randomly picks a number between 1 and 100.
	2.	User Input Loop
The user can guess repeatedly until the correct number is found.
	3.	Reveal Answer Feature
Typing "answer" displays the hidden number.
	4.	Comparison & Feedback System
The program informs the user whether the guess is correct or not.
	5.	Clean and Simple Output
Clear instructions and responses for easy interaction.
